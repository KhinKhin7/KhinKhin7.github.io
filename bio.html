		<p class="bio_par"> Hello! <br> <br> My name is Khin Khin, and yes, my first and last name are the same :) <br> I am currently a junior at New York University studying Integrated Design and Media with a minor in Media, Culture, & Communication. 
		<br> I created this website to showcase my photography journey and to take you along with me! I am an amateur photographer and I have been trying to experiment with different genres and styles as an effort to find my own. I love taking pictures of my friends and family to keep record of all our beautiful moments together (but they're also like my test subjects for me to experiment and gain experience from). 
		<br>
		<br> The next mission in my photography journey is to take pictures of strangers. I am an extremely introverted person so it would a perfect way to break out of my shell and gain more experience because I really do enjoy taking portaits of people. I also plan on taking pictures of infrastructure. I used to major in Civil Engineering and architecture, especially in NYC, has a special place in my heart. </p>
