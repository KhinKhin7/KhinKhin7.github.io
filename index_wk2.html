						Bush focuses on storing and sharing ideas and information.
						He talks about multiple technological advancements in his essay. <br>
						He also talks about how scientists have had to leave their path and do things that they never originally planned to do. <br>
						Science has, in Bush's opinion, improved our way of living because it has given us food, clothing, shelter, more security, <br> and improved mental health. 
						It has also allowed us to have swift communication across the world between individuals. <br>
						We have been able to create machines and technologies that are actually reliable.

				<u>LONG LIVE THE WEB BY TIM BERNERS LEE (2010)</u>

						We as a society should protect the web in order to protect ourselves and the future generations. <br>
						Protecting the web means protecting our basic human rights such as free speech, our ability to receive and spread information. <br>
						Monopolizing the web will end up cutting us off from the unlimited information that is out there, which is one of the best things about the web now. <br>
						Monopolizing will mean information will no longer be free, you would also need permission to do most things because you would be confined within the boundaries drawn by the company in power. <br>
						We must also keep the web and the internet separate so they can improve independently from each other. <br>
						We must protect the web so we can keep our information safe and so that we are free to do as we please without having to conform to anybody's rules.

						Both of these articles were interesting to read and put into perspective the how the developments of technologies have shaped our world.  
						So much so that we take them for granted now. It is important to step back and realize the impact they have had and will have on our lives and the future generations.
